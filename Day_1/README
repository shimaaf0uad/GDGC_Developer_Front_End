## 📌 Task 1: Create a Simple Webpage  

### 📝 Task Description  
In this task, the goal was to create a **basic webpage using HTML** to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts. The webpage needed to include:  
- ✅ A **title and headings** to structure content  
- ✅ A **paragraph** describing myself  
- ✅ An **image** to enhance the design  
- ✅ A **hyperlink** to an external website  
- ✅ A **section about my hobbies**  

This task helped reinforce the **foundations of HTML** and how to structure a webpage effectively.

## 🛠 Solution Implementation  
To achieve this, I followed these steps:  

1. **Setting Up the Project**:  
   - Created an `index.html` file to structure the webpage.  

2. **Adding Content**:  
   - Used `<h1>` for the main heading.  
   - Used `<p>` to add descriptions.  
   - Inserted an image using `<img>` tag.  
   - Added a hyperlink with `<a>` tag.  

3. **Running the Webpage**:  
   - Opened the file in a browser using **Live Server** in VS Code.  

### 💻 Code Snippet  
Here is a simple version of the HTML structure:  

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage created with HTML.</p>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am learning HTML because I want to become a great web developer!</p>
